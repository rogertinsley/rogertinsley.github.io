Devweek is over for another year...

<!-- more -->

Devweek 2012 was held at the Barbican Centre, London between 26 and the 30th March of this year. I attended the pre-conference HTML5 workshop with Jeff Prosise and concluded with a day of .NET patterns and principles with Dave Wheeler from Finite Plane Solutions.

The keynote was demo-filled, developer orientated on the upcoming Windows 8 experience, and to be honest the Metro UI is very fluid and slick. The hardware isn't up to scratch at the minute, but give it time. As a developer on Microsoft platforms my biggest takeaway thought was WinRT - .NET is now a second class citizen on the desktop...

What about the sessions?
-------------------------

I attended the following sessions: a .NET developer's guide to WinRT, Building Metro based applications, Behaviour Driven Design/Development and .NET, Pragmatic Architecture, ASP.NET Web API, Model Binding in ASP.NET MVC, Dynamic consumption in C# 4.0, Dynamic C# - The provider side and an introduction to NodeJS.

If you get a chance to go to Devweek - go! I thoroughly enjoyed myself and I'm already planning my strategy to attend the 2013 conference.

Silverlight is dead, long live HTML5
-------------------------

A Microsoft conference, with no Silverlight sessions... Interesting, isn't it?

This illustrates Microsoft's shift to HTML5 applications for the web and WinRT powered Metro applications for the desktop. I don't see Silverlight disappearing anytime soon, but surely Silverlight is on its last legs.

Summary
---------

An excellent week, I met new people, chatted about technology, frameworks and processes.

Roll on Devweek 2013. But, in the meantime I'm off to learn.
