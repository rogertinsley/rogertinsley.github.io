I've just received an email from Microsoft, apparently its time for me to renew my [Microsoft Certified Trainer](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mct.aspx) certification. 

Doesn't time fly?

###Requirements

According to the MCT renewal program guide the following requirements are required for the 2012 program year:

+ Maintain program qualifying credentials
+ Maintain acceptable customer satisfaction scores
+ The ability to prove your instructional presentation skills

###Qualifying credentials

I pass this with flying colours, I'm a MCPD Web Developer 4 & 3.5, I've MCTS exams in SharePoint 2010, .NET 4 Data Access, .NET 4 Service Communication Applications, SQL Server 2008, to name a fewâ€¦

###Customer Satisfaction

All students submit feedback via [Metrics That Matter](http://www.metricsthatmatter.com/), I provide the scores and comments to Microsoft for their evaluation.

Some folk I know take feedback personally, it provokes resentment, resistance, defensiveness and even a sense of failure. I take a more pragmatic view, feedback increases my self-awareness, offers me opinions and encourages my own self-development. At the end of the day, no-one is perfect and everyone can be better at what they do.

###Proving my instructional presentation skills

I'm currently teaching a Microsoft Certified Course one night a week at my local College, so I nail this requirement.

###Taken the plunge

So, I've taken the plunge and reapplied for my MCT, you do get a nice TechNet Plus Direct subscription, so why not?

On a more serious note, I want to keep the MCT to keep up the momentum of my passion for the industry, I plan to study for more MCTS exams in the near future to keep on learning.

If you're looking any Microsoft training, feel free to contact me. Shameless plug end :)
